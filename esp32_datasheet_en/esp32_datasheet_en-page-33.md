### **4.6.2 2.4 GHz Transmitter**

The 2.4 GHz transmitter modulates the quadrature baseband signals to the 2.4 GHz RF signal, and drives the antenna with a high-powered Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) power amplifier. The use of digital calibration further improves the linearity of the power amplifier, enabling state-of-the-art performance in delivering up to +20.5 dBm of power for an 802.11b transmission and +18 dBm for an 802.11n transmission.

Additional calibrations are integrated to cancel any radio imperfections, such as:

- Carrier leakage
- I/Q phase matching
- Baseband nonlinearities
- RF nonlinearities
- Antenna matching

These built-in calibration routines reduce the amount of time required for product testing, and render the testing equipment unnecessary.

### **4.6.3 Clock Generator**

The clock generator produces quadrature clock signals of 2.4 GHz for both the receiver and the transmitter. All components of the clock generator are integrated into the chip, including all inductors, varactors, filters, regulators, and dividers.

The clock generator has built-in calibration and self-test circuits. Quadrature clock phases and phase noise are optimized on-chip with patented calibration algorithms which ensure the best performance of the receiver and the transmitter.

### **4.6.4 Wi-Fi Radio and Baseband**

ESP32 implements a TCP/IP and full 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi MAC protocol. It supports the Basic Service Set (BSS) STA and SoftAP operations under the Distributed Control Function (DCF). Power management is handled with minimal host interaction to minimize the active-duty period.

The ESP32 Wi-Fi Radio and Baseband support the following features:

- 802.11b/g/n
- 802.11n MCS0-7 in both 20 MHz and 40 MHz bandwidth
- 802.11n MCS32 (RX)
- 802.11n 0.4 µs guard-interval
- up to 150 Mbps of data rate
- Receiving STBC 2×1
- Up to 20.5 dBm of transmitting power
- Adjustable transmitting power

Antenna diversity ESP32 supports antenna diversity with an external RF switch. One or more GPIOs control the RF switch and selects the best antenna to minimize the effects of channel fading.
